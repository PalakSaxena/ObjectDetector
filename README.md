# ObjectDetector

I have provided all the files required for Object Detection.
Coco.names is the file containing object classes to be detected.
frozen_inference_graph.pb is the file containing weights of the object classes.
dnn file contains the configurations of the objects to be detected.
When an object is detected, the class name of the object and the confidence(possibility value) is shown.
